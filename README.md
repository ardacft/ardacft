- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @ardacft
- ðŸ‘€ I'm an undergrad physics student. In spare time, I go after and explore anything that I am curious about. Usually what keeps me motivated is to understand something or just to reach some level of appreciation on something alien to me. I also enjoy creating simple stuff, like simple programs, sounds, images, models etc for the same reason but also for communicating an idea through something more concrete and comprehendable.
